# Parity baselines

A baseline is a production build of the Jekyll site Folia replaces, recorded together with
Jekyll's own intermediate results. Folia's output is checked against baselines, so they must be
reproducible and trustworthy: building the same commit twice gives the same result, and recording
the intermediate results does not change the site.

## Requirements

- The reference Jekyll site checked out next to this repository (`../filopoe`), with its gems
  installed (`bundle install` there). Set `FOLIA_SITE` to use another path.
- Ruby and Bundler, as the site's `Gemfile` requires.
- Baselines are written to `../folia-baselines`, outside both repositories. Set
  `FOLIA_BASELINES` to use another directory.

## Building a baseline

```sh
just baseline e872c37
```

This runs `scripts/baseline.sh ../filopoe ../folia-baselines/e872c37`, which:

1. refuses to build a site with uncommitted changes, unless `--allow-dirty` is given
   (`just baseline my-label --allow-dirty`);
2. refuses to overwrite an existing baseline;
3. records the site and Folia commits, the tool versions and the build flags in `BASELINE.json`;
4. builds the site with `JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build --disable-disk-cache`,
   loading the dump plugin from this repository;
5. checks that the build left the site's working tree as it found it, that the manifest
   accounts for every built file, and that no date fell back to a file's mtime: such a date
   depends on the checkout, not the commit, so the baseline would not be reproducible.

The baseline directory holds:

| Path | Contents |
|-|-|
| `site/` | the production build |
| `dump/manifest.jsonl` | one row per page, document and static file (below) |
| `dump/content/<source>.html` | body HTML after Liquid, generators and Markdown conversion, before layouts |
| `dump/content/_by_output/<output>.html` | the same, for pages that share a source (pagination) |
| `dump/excerpt/<source>.html` | each document's rendered excerpt |
| `dump/meta/<source>.json` | title, date, `last_modified_at` (resolved, its origin, and the front matter value), categories, tags |

`last_modified_at_from` says where each date came from: `front_matter`, `git` (the last commit
touching the file), or `mtime` (no commit touches it). Jekyll uses front matter only for documents;
for pages the git date always wins (plan v3, §2.6).
| `BASELINE.json` | what was built, and with what |
| `build.log` | Jekyll's output |

Each manifest row has these fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|-|-|
| `kind` | `page`, `document` or `static` |
| `collection` | the collection label (`posts`, `micro`, `digital_garden`), or `null` |
| `class` | the Ruby class, which tells generated pages apart (`JekyllFeed::PageWithoutAFile`, `JekyllRedirectFrom::RedirectPage`, …) |
| `source` | the source path, or `null` for generated pages |
| `url` | the URL Jekyll assigned |
| `output` | the file written, relative to `site/` |
| `written` | whether Jekyll wrote it |
| `content`, `excerpt`, `meta` | the dump files for this row, or `null` |

## Comparing baselines

```sh
just compare e872c37 other-label [expected-diffs.txt]
```

`scripts/compare-builds.sh` compares the `dump/` trees byte for byte and the `site/` trees after
exactly one normalization: the feed-level `<updated>` of each Atom feed, which Jekyll sets to the
build time. The sitemap and the Lunr index are also compared entry by entry, so a different order
is reported as *reordered* rather than as a change (see below). Any other difference fails the
comparison, unless it is listed in the optional expected-differences file, one path per line
relative to the baseline root (`site/about.html`, `dump/content/pages/about.md.html`), with `#`
starting a comment.

## Verifying the harness

```sh
just baseline-verify e872c37
```

This builds the baseline and runs the spike 0 acceptance checks against two throwaway builds:

1. a second run gives byte-identical dumps and the same normalized site;
2. a build without the plugin gives the same normalized site;
3. the manifest accounts for every built file.

## How the dump plugin works

`parity/jekyll/folia_dump.rb` is loaded with
`--plugins <site>/_plugins,<folia>/parity/jekyll`, so the site itself is not modified. It
registers no hooks unless `FOLIA_DUMP` names an empty directory. When it does, a `post_convert`
hook copies each body as it stands between conversion and layouts, and a `post_write` hook writes
the manifest and the dumps. The hooks only read site state.

!!! note "Keep `parity/jekyll/` for the plugin only"
    Jekyll loads every `.rb` file below a plugins directory, so helper scripts live in `parity/`.

## Reproducibility limits

Two builds of the same checkout are identical apart from the feed-level `<updated>`. A fresh
clone of the same commit differs in two ways, both existing Jekyll behavior:

- Jekyll reads directories in filesystem order, so the order of pages in `sitemap.xml` and the
  Lunr index differs between clones. That order carries no meaning: `compare-builds.sh` compares
  these files entry by entry (`parity/same_entries.py`) and reports them as *reordered*, which
  does not fail the comparison. A changed entry still does.
- `jekyll-sitemap` dates the 7 static files it lists (6 PDFs and the Yandex verification page)
  by their mtime, which in a clone is the checkout time. This is not normalized: comparing
  baselines from different checkouts reports `sitemap.xml` as changed.

`parity/evidence/fresh-clone-542c9a9/` holds the comparison that shows both.

## Removing Liquid from the content (spike 3)

```sh
just deliquify check                      # print the rewrite as a diff
just deliquify write                      # apply it to the reference site
just baseline deliquified --allow-dirty   # build the uncommitted result
just compare e872c37 deliquified parity/spike3-expected.txt
just check-d001 e872c37 deliquified       # the expected differences are D-001 only
```

`parity/codemods/deliquify.py` rewrites only the constructs in plan §10, in the 15 files listed in
the script, and fails with the file and line on any other Liquid. The expected differences are
listed in `parity/spike3-expected.txt`, and the deviation they come from in
`parity/deviations.toml`.

## Checking routes (spike 2)

```sh
just routes 542c9a9
```

The parity tool (`crates/parity`) has Folia plan every output of the reference site, from the
configuration in `parity/filopoe.toml`, and compares the plan with the baseline's manifest:

1. every authored output: the multiset of (source, URL, output file);
2. the classification of each source: post, micro entry, garden note, page or static file;
3. every generated output (pagination, archives, feeds, redirect stubs, the sitemap, …): the
   set of (URL, output file);
4. the redirect stubs.

Folia itself refuses a plan where two outputs share a URL or an output file. The tool refuses a
site checkout that is not the clean commit the baseline was built from, and uses the baseline's
build time to decide what was future-dated.

## Reproducing from a clean checkout

You need [just](https://just.systems), a stable Rust toolchain with `cargo-deny`, Ruby 3.3 with
Bundler, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Node.js. Baselines stay outside both repositories,
in `../folia-baselines`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggirelli/folia.git && cd folia
just check                                    # needs neither the site nor a baseline
git clone https://github.com/ggirelli/filopoe.git ../filopoe
(cd ../filopoe && bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle && bundle install)
```

`filopoe` does not track its `Gemfile.lock`; each baseline records the lock file's SHA-256 in
`BASELINE.json`, and the reference baselines used Jekyll 4.4.1 on Ruby 3.3.8.

**Spikes 0 and 3** start from the site before the Liquid rewrite, commit `e872c37`. Build them
from a separate clone at that commit, so the main checkout is untouched:

```sh
git clone ../filopoe ../filopoe-e872c37 && git -C ../filopoe-e872c37 checkout e872c37
cp ../filopoe/Gemfile.lock ../filopoe-e872c37/   # untracked, so a clone lacks it
(cd ../filopoe-e872c37 && bundle config set --local path ../filopoe/vendor/bundle)
export FOLIA_SITE=../filopoe-e872c37
just baseline-verify e872c37                  # spike 0
just deliquify check && just deliquify write  # spike 3: review, then apply the rewrite
just baseline deliquified --allow-dirty
just compare e872c37 deliquified parity/spike3-expected.txt
just check-d001 e872c37 deliquified
unset FOLIA_SITE
```

**The rebaseline and spike 2** use `542c9a96`, the commit that applied the rewrite. Until it is
published to the site's repository it exists only in the local checkout, and these steps need it:

```sh
git -C ../filopoe checkout 542c9a96
just baseline-verify 542c9a9
just check-date-shift deliquified 542c9a9     # the rebaseline moved only dates
just routes 542c9a9                           # spike 2
```

Baselines of the same commit from different checkouts can differ in page order and static-file
dates (see the reproducibility limits above); route parity does not depend on either.
